# Bresenham Algorithm with Stack Implementation in Assembly 8086

This repository contains an implementation of the Bresenham algorithm in Assembly language (8086 architecture) with the use of a stack. The Bresenham algorithm is commonly used for drawing lines on a computer screen and is known for its efficiency in raster graphics applications. By utilizing a stack-based approach, this implementation offers an alternative method for drawing lines with random cycle counts, providing insights into the internal workings of the algorithm.

## Description

The Bresenham algorithm is an efficient method for rendering lines on a raster display. It calculates the points along a line that are closest to the ideal mathematical line equation, producing a visually smooth and accurate result. In this implementation, the Bresenham algorithm is executed using Assembly language (8086 architecture) and utilizes a stack to manage line drawing operations.

The use of a stack in the Bresenham algorithm implementation, simulating variations in processing time and providing insights into the algorithm's performance under different conditions. By pushing and popping values onto and from the stack, the implementation explores different execution paths, resulting in unique line drawing outcomes with varying cycle counts.

## Features

### 1. Stack-based Line Drawing

The implementation utilizes a stack data structure to manage line drawing operations in the Bresenham algorithm. By pushing and popping values onto and from the stack, the algorithm dynamically adjusts its execution path, resulting in unique line drawing outcomes with random cycle counts.

### 2. Random Cycle Counts

The use of a stack introduces randomness into the cycle counts of the Bresenham algorithm, simulating variations in processing time and execution paths. This randomness provides insights into the algorithm's behavior under different conditions and allows for experimentation with line drawing performance.

### 3. Visualization (Optional)

Optionally, the implementation can provide visualizations of the lines drawn using the Bresenham algorithm with stack. These visualizations may include diagrams, graphs, or simulated screen outputs to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in rendering lines on a raster display.
